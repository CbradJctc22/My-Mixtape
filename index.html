<img src="entreprenuer.jpg" alt="Mixtape Cover" class="header" class="center">
        <p>You gotta let go (Let go!)</br>
If you wanna fly and take the leap</br>
You gotta risk it all (Risk it all!)</br>
Or there'll be lots of things you'll never see</br>
You gotta let, let go</br>
'Cause you never know</br>
What's in store</br>
Mr. Entrepreneur</br>

In this position with no choice</br>
The system imprison young black boys</br>
Distract with white noise</br>
The brainwashed become hype boys</br>
Third eye dilate</br>
You ain't supposed to make it off Section 8</br>
Robbin' Peter just to pay Paul</br>
Prepare to risk everything</br></br>

      <h2 id="two">Jeezy- Almighty Black Dollar</h2>
<img src="jeezy.jpg" alt="Mixtape Cover" class="header" class="center">
        <p> All I wanna do is see the real men be rewarded</br>
Not worried about a bag, go and buy a whole city for my daughter</br>
Big homie 65 still doing time, that's in the feds</br>
What's the use of climbing to the mountaintop if you're living on the ledge?</br>
Shot the homie in the stomach now he walking around with shit bag</br>
Burnt down Black Wall Street now it's time for the get back</br>
Violate a young man probation for a piss test</br>
Got a hug from my momma, whispered in my ear, "We gon' beat this"</br>
War ready</br>
Black Power</br>
Financial Freedom</br>
The Black dollar</br>
Slave labor</br>
No love</br>
Back to business, pay what you owe us</p></br></br>

      <h2 id="three">Miguel - Candles in the Sun</h2>
<img src="miguel.jpg" alt="Mixtape Cover" class="header" class="center">
        <p>Diamond in the back,</br>
Babies on crack,</br>
Kickin' the door,</br>
Waving the four four</br>
White-collared war crime, money gets spent</br>
Just candles in the sun, blowing in the wind</br>
Sun goes down.</br>
Heroes often get shot</br>
Peace has long been forgot got</br>
Ohh it'll be too late when we find out</br>
We're all that we got</br>
Take a look around now</br>
Just take a look around</br>

Business and governments just, watch as the innocent fade.</br>
Mindless bureaucracy fails, hindering government aid.</br></br>

      <h2 id="four">Alicia Keys - Back to Life</h2>
<img src="backtolife.jpg" alt="Mixtape Cover" class="header" class="center">
        <p>Climb out from the bottom baby</br>
No more looking back only straight up</br>
Foot on the pedal baby, it's time to find what you're made of</br>
Everybody wants to be adored</br>
You don't have to settle for being ignored</br>
Back to life, back to life</br>
Nothing can break you</br>
I will survive, oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah</br>
Back to life</br>

I'm not made to be locked up</br>
If a bird don't fly, then what were wings made for?</br>
Oh, I'm not meant to be locked up</br>
And if I don't try, then what was I made for?</br></br>

        <h2 id="five">Beyonce - Black Parade</h2>
<img src="parade.jpg" alt="Mixtape Cover" class="header" class="center">
        <p>I'm going back to the South</br>
I'm going back, back, back, back</br>
Where my roots ain't watered down</br>
Growing, growing like a Baobab tree</br>
Of life on fertile ground, my ancestors put me on game</br>
Ankh charm on gold chains, with my Oshun energy, oh</br>
Drip all on me, woo, Ankara Dashiki print</br>
Hold up, don't I smell like such a nag champa incense?</br>
Yeah, pure ice (ice), ice (ice), buss down</br>
Uh, flooded (flooded), flooded (flooded), on my wrist, out</br>
Ooh, going up, going up, motherland, motherland drip on me</br>
Ooh, melanin, melanin, my drip is skin deep, like</br>
Ooh, motherland, motherland, motherland, motherland drip on me</br>
Ooh, yeah, I can't forget my history is her story, yeah</br>
Being black, maybe that's the reason why</br>
They're always mad, yeah, they're always mad, yeah</br>
Been past 'em, I know that's the reason why</br>
They're all big mad and they always have been</br></br>

<img src="nickelback.jpg" alt="Mixtape Cover" class="header" class="center">
        <p>From underneath the trees</br>
We watch the sky</br>
Confusing stars for satellites</br>
I never dreamed that you'd be mine</br>
But here we are, we're here tonight</br>

Singing, Amen, I</br>
I'm alive (I'm alive)</br>
Singing Amen, I</br>
I'm alive</br>
If everyone cared and nobody cried</br>
If everyone loved and nobody lied</br>
If everyone shared and swallowed their pride</br>
Then we'd see the day when nobody died</p></br>

<img src="selfcare.jpg" alt="Mixtape Cover" class="header" class="center">
        <p>Well, climbin' over that wall (Yeah, wall, wall,) mm</br>
I remember, yes, I remember, yes, I remember it all</br>
Swear the height be too tall (Yeah), so like September I fall</br>
(Down, down, down)</br>
Down below, now I know that the medicine be on call, yeah (Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme)</br>
It's feelin' like you hot enough to melt, yeah (Melt, yeah)</br>
Can't trust no one, can't even trust yourself, yeah (-Self, yeah)</br>
And I love you, I don't love nobody else, yeah (Else, yeah)</br>

    <h2 id="eight">Chris Stapleton - Tennessee Whiskey</h2>
<img src="whiskey.jpg" alt="Mixtape Cover" class="header" class="center">
        <p>Used to spend my nights out in a barroom</br>
Liquor was the only love I'd known</br>
But you rescued me from reaching for the bottom</br>
And brought me back from being too far gone</br>

You're as smooth as Tennessee whiskey</br>
You're as sweet as strawberry wine</br>
You're as warm as a glass of brandy</br>
And honey, I stay stoned on your love all the time</br>

I've looked for love in all the same old places</br>
Found the bottom of the bottle's always dry</br>
But when you poured out your heart I didn't waste it</br>
'Cause there's nothing like your love to get me high</br></br>
</p>

    <h2 id="nine">Alessia Cara - Here</h2>
<img src="here.jpg" alt="Mixtape Cover" class="header" class="center">
        <p>I'm sorry if I seem uninterested</br>
Or I'm not listenin' or I'm indifferent</br>
Truly, I ain't got no business here</br>
But since my friends are here</br>
I just came to kick it but really</br>
I would rather be at home all by myself not in this room</br>
With people who don't even care about my well-being</br>
I don't dance, don't ask, I don't need a boyfriend</br>
So you can go back, please enjoy your party</br>
I'll be here, somewhere in the corner under clouds of marijuana</br>
With this boy who's hollering I can hardly hear</br>
Over this music I don't listen to and I don't wanna get with you</br>
So tell my friends that I'll be over here</br>
</p>

<img src="city.jpg" alt="Mixtape Cover" class="header" class="center">

  Never too big of a price (What?)</br>
  After I buy the Chicago Bulls (What?), I'ma go link with Mike (What?)</br>
  And if I let 'em have my wife, niggas should thank me</br>
  With this Balenciaga and Balenci' boots and a new blue Yankee</br>
